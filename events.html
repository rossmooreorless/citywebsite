The ever popular Bluegrass Festival featuring some of the finest acts in the world. This has now developed into a great event with the tops in Bluegrass in Town. A weekend not to be missed!

Bluegrass combines elements of old-time mountain music, square dance fiddling, blues, gospel, jazz, and popular music. Like jazz, bluegrass allows performers to improvise and take turns playing lead. Its distinctive timing surges slightly ahead of or anticipates the main beat, creating an energized effect.

                    9th - 24th July 2023 - Ardara

                    Donegal’s premier summer event Earagail Arts Festival is making a welcome return to its full programme of events along the Wild Atlantic Way from 9th to 24th July with one of the many highlights being the Wild Atlantic Weekend.

                    Malin’s Big Top On The Green will host a series of events beginning with the death-defying aerialist, hardcore acrobat, mind bending jugglers of Bang On presented by Tumble Circus (3pm July 21st & 22nd.  2pm July 23rd & 24th). A ragin’, ravin’, revolutionary big top show of class circus, big laughs and dead on skill.

Superstar Circus and Circus Disco (4pm July 23rd & 24th) continue the festivities with three circus enthusiasts Jimmy, Gabbo, and AD.  Superstar Circus (20 min) share their amazing tricks with the world and these circus heroes will charm their way into your hearts. You’ll see that there’s no such thing as failure, only another chance to try it again. And before you know it, you’ll be trying it too.

Superstar Circus is followed by the Circus Disco (40 min), where the stars of Super Star Circus supply the Juggling Balls, Clubs, Diablos, Flowerstick, Hula Hoops, and maybe a unicycle or two, for a fun “try it out” atmosphere. Nobody is too old or too young to try, and the way YOU use the equipment is the correct way to use it.

Bill and Fred’s Adventures (12pm July 23rd & 24th) showcases the clownesque expression of dance. Abstract in style, Bill & Fred bring their audience on a journey of discovery and laughter.

Two professional and well-travelled adventurers, both less than useless without one another, together become master resolvers of the absurd. The duo brings a profound level of precision to their movement built through years of experience in improvisation, clowning and dance.
